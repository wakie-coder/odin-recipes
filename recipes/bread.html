        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast by putting it in the warm water with 
                a little bit of sugar, usually the plastic container give a 
                specified amount to it so use that amount for both water and 
                sugar, if not, for 500g of bread powder, you should use a 
                teaspoon of sugar and a cup and a half of water and leave it 
                to rest aproximately 10 to 15 minutes in ambient temperature.</li>
            <li>Make the bread dough by adding 500g of bread powder, two 
                tablespoons of salt, the yeast with the water, and a teaspoon
                oil. Whisk all the ingredients until they form a dough-like 
                texture.</li>

                dough until the dough is soft and elastic.</li>    
            <li>Let the though rise by putting it back in a container without
                a lid, instead use a wet towel and leave it in a warm enviroment
                for about an hour or an hour and a half.</li>
            <li>Punch the dough, and leave it back on the container that you
